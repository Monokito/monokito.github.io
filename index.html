<h1> Monokito.sync project</h1>


 <p>Hello world! This is Monokito. Currently Yumi and I are working on this site, messing around with the coding. We will be updating this site frequently.


    On this site you will find music and writings by the Monokito.sync project.</p>






 <h2>Monokito music and writings</h2>


 <p>  It is very cool to share the music and writings of the Monokito.sync project with the world. You can already listen to music by Monokito.


   We posted some nice tunes on Soundcloud. Later on we will add some more socials.</p>

 <h2> Why is Monokito.sync keeping this website so basic?</h2/>


  <p> The reason why we keep the site so basic, is that we like the web 1.0 esthetic so much. Besides that, a site is more clear when it is text based and has the relevant links on it.


      It is nice to see that one can host a website for free, that way it is not necessary to pay a zillion dollards a month.


      We can deliver our message and share video, music and text with you guys.</p> 


    


  


 <h2> Monokito is loving simplicity?</h2/>


 <p> Just keeping it simple, as it was in the old days. This has proven to be a wonderful view for the Monokito.sync project.


     Have fun and keep on checking out this site. We are currently working to update this site with a nice hierarchy. </p>
